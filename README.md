# My Code Card

## Technologies

My Code Card is a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The framework Material-UI was used for the front-end design.

## The Why

My Code Card is an app that organizes knowledge learned and makes that information easily accessible. The ultimate goal of this app is simplicity. While there other sites/apps similar to My Code Card, most of them are not quite as simple and easy to use as this one. With this app the user creates categories and then populates those categories with information cards realted to that category. The user can add a title, notes, and a link on each info card. 

While the original idea of this app was to help students going through a Coding Bootcamp, the ways in which this app can be applied are endless and not strictly reserved to Code Bootcamps. Users can use this app for whatever domain of knowledge they would like.
